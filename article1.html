                <h2>The Confusing Start</h2>
                <p>After completing my 12th grade in 2017, I found myself in the same position as many others—trying to figure out what to do next. I was certain I wanted to pursue Engineering, but I had no idea which branch to choose: Civil, Mechanical, Computer Science, or Electrical. I spent hours Googling "Best engineering stream with great career and pay" and kept asking seniors and relatives for guidance. Despite all the research, I remained confused.</p>
                <p>Eventually, in 2018, I decided to take admission in Computer Science and Engineering.</p>

                <h2>The College Dilemma and Early Struggles</h2>
                <p>I enrolled at Shivaji University, Kolhapur, and while I was excited, the first year of college hit me hard. Understanding programming was a real pain for me in the beginning. It was nothing like what I had imagined—it took effort, patience, and countless retries to get even the basics right.</p>
                <p>But slowly, things started to make sense. I built a few basic Python projects, and that helped me gain some confidence. Still, I wasn't someone who fell in love with coding or aspired to become a hardcore developer.</p>

            <section id="cloud-curiosity">
                <h2>Cloud Curiosity</h2>
                <p>During college, I got introduced to AWS and GCP, mostly out of casual curiosity. I participated in the GCP Cloud Facilitator Program, honestly more excited about the Google goodies than anything else. At that time, I didn't know anything about DevOps or the real power of cloud services. I just lightly explored the basics—how to set up an EC2 instance, host a static site using S3, and so on. Concepts like CI/CD, Jenkins, or system reliability were completely unknown to me back then. But those small experiences planted a seed of curiosity about how real-world systems work behind the scenes.</p>

            <section id="first-job">
                <h2>The First Job and the DevOps Twist</h2>
                <p>After graduating in 2022, I landed my first full-time job at Coditas on August 8, 2022. That's where my real journey began.</p>
                <p>I was placed into the DevOps team—without any prior experience or preference. I didn't even know what DevOps meant. I was honestly confused and a little concerned about why I wasn't asked what I wanted to do. But I decided to give it a shot. Like any curious newcomer, I immediately Googled:</p>
                <p>"What is DevOps?"</p>
                <p>"What's the career scope and salary in DevOps?"</p>
                <p>Then I started diving into internal documentation, YouTube videos, and whatever resources I could find.</p>

            <section id="present-day">
                <h2>Where I Stand Today</h2>
                <p>Like everyone starting out, I had doubts—about my role, my future, and my ability to grow in this space. But today, I have no more doubts. I enjoy DevOps. I learn something new every single day, and that's what keeps me going.</p>
                <p>I proudly call myself a DevOps Engineer, and this is the path I want to continue on—building, automating, learning, and growing.</p>
                <p>In my next article, I'll share the first set of tools and technologies I worked with in DevOps, how I learned them, and what challenges I faced.</p>
