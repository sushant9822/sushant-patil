                <p>Let me take you back to the beginning of my journey as a DevOps Engineer, to a time when the concept was entirely foreign to me. But before diving into that, I'd recommend checking out my previous article, where I share how I stumbled into the world of DevOps in the first place.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="first-day">
                <h2>The First Day</h2>
                <p>It all began on August 8, 2022—my first day as a full-time Developer, fresh out of college. I was excited, nervous, and clueless about what lay ahead. I had a typical college mindset, mostly theoretical knowledge, and no idea how real-world products were built, scaled, or maintained.</p>
                <p>But stepping into a company that builds products solving real-world problems? That was a different feeling altogether. I realized early on that this was a space where learning is constant—and it had to start immediately.</p>
                <p>I was placed into the DevOps Platform Team. Honestly, I didn't know what DevOps really meant. I was handed internal documentation, useful YouTube channels, and told to attend stand-up calls. I just dove in.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="a-whole-new-world">
                <h2>A Whole New World</h2>
                <p>From day one, I began learning Python and enrolled in an AWS Solutions Architect course to understand cloud fundamentals. Still, I felt a bit behind in areas like system design—I didn't yet grasp how large-scale architecture works or how services connect.</p>
                <p>To bridge that gap, I started mapping how real-world applications like Amazon, Flipkart, WhatsApp, Instagram might be built. I'd think about the backend, the frontend, the cloud, the infra, the data flow. This habit helped me link the theory with practical DevOps applications.</p>

            <section id="foggy-phase">
                <h2>The Foggy Phase</h2>
                <p>In the early weeks, everything felt like a blur. There were terms I had never heard before—provisioning, scaling, deployment pipelines, orchestration, IaC, CI/CD—it was like learning a whole new language.</p>
                <p>I remember Googling:</p>
                <p>"What does a DevOps Engineer do?"</p>
                <p>That pretty much sums up how I felt then. Every day brought something new and unfamiliar. But I kept going—reading, watching, and asking questions.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="when-things-started-to-click">
                <h2>When Things Started to Click</h2>
                <p>Eventually, I was given my first real task: log into an AWS account and write Terraform code to deploy a demo project to Lambda. It took me almost a week, but when I finally got it working and saw that static website live—it clicked. That feeling of solving something tangible was priceless.</p>
                <p>From there, things started to fall into place. I began to understand the processes behind infrastructure provisioning, deployment, monitoring, and automation.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="real-projects-real-learning">
                <h2>Real Projects, Real Learning</h2>
                <p>Slowly, I started getting assigned to live projects. Each issue, each bug, each deployment became a new learning opportunity. That's when I truly understood the beauty of DevOps—it's not just about tools; it's about mindset and ownership.</p>
                <p>I began contributing to the infrastructure repository, understanding CI/CD workflows, managing cloud resources, writing infrastructure as code, and solving problems that impacted real users.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="present-day">
                <h2>The Present Day</h2>
                <p>Today, a few years into this journey, I no longer feel lost. I understand the systems I work with. I can break down problems, propose solutions, and confidently say:</p>
                <p>"Yes, I'm a DevOps Engineer—and I love it."</p>
                <p>There's still a lot to learn—DevOps is a constantly evolving field. But that's the best part. Every day is a learning and improvement day.</p>
                <p>Whether it's building scalable architectures, debugging deployments, or exploring new tools—this journey is just getting started, and I'm excited for what's ahead.</p>
